      "The Versa Connect takes these attributes and focuses on extending them seamlessly into the wheelchair accessible aspects of our vehicle. It is our aim to produce a conversion that is both practical and stylish, with an attention to detail that provides the same high quality look and feel throughout the vehicle.",
      "The Versa Connect is available in two wheelbases. The Short Versa Connect can accommodate the wheelchair user and up to 3 seated passengers (including the driver) or up to 5 seated passengers without the wheelchair. The Long Versa Connect can accommodate the wheelchair user and up to 5 seated passengers (including the driver) or up to 7 seated passengers without the wheelchair.",
      "Twin sliding doors allow for ease of passenger access with a lightweight manual ramp to the rear for wheelcair access. As an optional extra, the ramp can have the added ability, using a simple lever, to fold- at into the vehicle so that when the wheelcair user is not travelling, a huge and easily accessible boot space is created making the Versa Connect even more practical."
